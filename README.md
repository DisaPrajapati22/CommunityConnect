# CommunityConnect
# is a android mobile app that aspires to make the students of McMaster a close knitted community. By displaying the current position of 
# friendly gatherings or social events allows for the students to create an experience to interact with those not in their relative program 
# and create strong bonds within the university with people who have similar interests. It gives the opportunity to socialize within the 
# ever heavy flow of work!
